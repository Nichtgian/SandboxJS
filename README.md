## Ambition
Sandbox is a in JavaScript and HTML Canvas developed raycast engine.
Future gamemodes can be limitless. The main focus relays on a smooth game experience,

For online gameplay a main lobby serves as serverbrowser. You can meet up with people here and join
public or create private servers. We'd like to implement a character or even weapon customisation.
